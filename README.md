# ambient-sensor

## what's this?
<ambient sensor ver.1.0.1> measures the bio-electric potential of a tree and visualizes it in real time.
The bio-electric potential goes up and down depending on the tree's environment (carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity, soil water content, air pressure, etc.). This sensor does not directly measure such environmental conditions, but rather senses the world through ("umwelt" of) the tree. Technology is not tools for remaking nature, but for connecting nature and humans.
